# Simulated DDoS Attack Response and Mitigation

This project is part of the cybersecurity virtual internship offered by Telstra on Forage, and the main idea behind is to perform some of the daily tasks that an Information Security Analyst would be tasked with. In this case, the situation is incident response by communicating with stakeholders, Threat analysis using network logs, mitigation by coding a firewall rule, and performing digital forensics by documenting and reflecting on the incident. For a full breackdown of the code and each step I took [click here](https://rafael-santamaria-ortega.github.io/cyber_incident_response.html).
